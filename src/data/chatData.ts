          why choose SignBridge?
          - Millions of deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals struggle with communication barriers that limit their access to essential services, education, and employment opportunities. One of our team members faces this challenge personally, as his brother is deaf, making conversations difficult at times. This issue extends beyond personal experiences, affecting communities across Africa and the world. Existing solutions, such as human interpreters and text-based communication, are often costly, inaccessible, or impractical for real-time interactions. To address this gap, we are developing SignBridge, an AI-powered real-time sign language translator. Using a webcam, our application will recognize and convert sign language gestures into text, allowing seamless communication between signers and non-signers.

          - This innovation is particularly valuable for individuals who rely on sign language, as well as for businesses, schools, and healthcare providers working to improve accessibility. By enabling real-time translation, SignBridge empowers the deaf and hard-of-hearing community to engage in conversations more easily, breaking down social and professional barriers. Beyond digital accessibility, our project fosters inclusivity, ensuring that communication becomes a bridge that connects people rather than a barrier that divides them.
